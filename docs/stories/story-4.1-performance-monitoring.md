# Story 4.1: Performance Monitoring & System Health

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator/developer,
**I want to** monitor application performance and system health,
**so that** I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API response times are monitored, with alerts for slow responses.
2. Database query performance is tracked.
3. Frontend application load times are measured.
4. Error rates are monitored, with alerts for significant spikes.
5. A system health dashboard provides a live overview of service status.
6. Automated alerts are sent for performance degradation or system downtime.
7. A centralized logging system is in place for debugging and analysis.
8. User activity and behavior analytics are collected.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Backend Monitoring** (AC: #1, #2, #4)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Integrate a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog) with the FastAPI backend.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement middleware to capture API response times and error rates.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add instrumentation to track the performance of critical database queries.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend Monitoring** (AC: #3, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Integrate a real user monitoring (RUM) tool with the Flutter application.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement tracking for screen load times and other key user interactions.
- [ ] **Task 3: Dashboard and Alerting** (AC: #5, #6)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Set up a monitoring dashboard (e.g., in Grafana, Datadog) to visualize the collected metrics.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Configure alert rules to notify the team of performance issues via Slack or email.
- [ ] **Task 4: Logging** (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Configure a centralized logging service (e.g., ELK stack, Logtail).
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Ensure that logs from all services (backend, frontend, database) are collected and searchable.

## Dev Notes
A robust monitoring and logging system is essential for maintaining a reliable service. This story involves integrating various tools to gain visibility into the application's performance and health. The goal is to move from a reactive to a proactive approach to issue resolution, identifying problems before they affect a significant number of users.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/backend/app/core/monitoring.py`: Contains the backend code for integrating with monitoring services.
- `apps/frontend/lib/core/services/performance_monitor.dart`: The Flutter service responsible for tracking frontend performance.
- `infra/monitoring/`: Contains configuration files for monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story is not directly dependent on any single functional story but rather provides a cross-cutting concern that applies to the entire system.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - N/A (Testing is primarily focused on verifying the monitoring integration).
- **Test Standards:**
  - The monitoring implementation itself should have minimal impact on application performance.
  - Alerts must be tested to ensure they are triggered correctly and are actionable.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Generate synthetic load and errors to test that the monitoring system correctly captures the data and triggers alerts.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Verify that a slow API endpoint (e.g., one with an artificial delay) is correctly flagged in the monitoring dashboard.
  - Trigger a series of errors and confirm that they appear in the error tracking system and that an alert is sent.
  - Test the frontend monitoring by simulating a slow network and verifying that the increased load times are reported.
