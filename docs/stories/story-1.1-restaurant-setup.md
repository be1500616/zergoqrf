## Dev Notes
This story provides the onboarding experience for new restaurant owners, which is a critical first impression of the platform. The registration process should be as smooth and intuitive as possible. The backend needs to handle the creation of a new tenant, including the restaurant profile and the owner's staff account, in a single atomic transaction to ensure data integrity.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/registration/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the restaurant registration flow.
- `apps/backend/app/features/restaurants/`: Contains the FastAPI routers and logic for creating and managing restaurant profiles.
- `infra/supabase/migrations/`: SQL files defining the `restaurants` table and related schemas.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story is dependent on **Story 1.0 (Authentication System)**, as it needs to create a user account for the restaurant owner and associate it with the new restaurant.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - The registration flow must be tested end-to-end.
  - Validate all input fields to ensure data integrity.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write integration tests that simulate the full registration API call and verify that all related database records (restaurant, staff, user) are created correctly.
  - Frontend: Use widget tests to validate the multi-step registration form. Use integration tests to simulate the user filling out the form and successfully creating an account.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the unique slug generation, ensuring it handles duplicate restaurant names correctly (e.g., by appending a number).
  - Verify that uploaded verification documents are stored securely.
  - Write tests for the business hours' configuration to handle various scenarios, such as 24-hour operations or split shifts.
