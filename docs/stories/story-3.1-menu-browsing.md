# Story 3.1: Public Menu Browsing (Zero-Friction Access)

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** dining customer,
**I want to** scan a QR code and immediately browse the restaurant's menu,
**so that** I can see food options without waiting for staff or downloading apps.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Scanning a QR code opens the menu directly in the mobile browser.
2. The menu loads within 2 seconds on a 3G connection.
3. No authentication, login, or app installation is required.
4. The menu is accessible to multiple customers at the same table simultaneously.
5. The design is responsive and optimized for mobile phones.
6. The restaurant's name, logo, and brand colors are prominently displayed.
7. The menu is organized by categories with smooth navigation.
8. Menu items display their name, description, price, and dietary indicators.
9. High-quality food images load progressively.
10. Tapping an item reveals a detailed view with customization options.
11. A search functionality is available to find specific items.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Public Menu Page** (AC: #1, #3, #5, #6)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create a public-facing, server-rendered page or a fast-loading single-page application (SPA) for the menu.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement a responsive layout that works seamlessly on mobile devices.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Ensure the restaurant's branding is dynamically loaded and displayed.
- [ ] **Task 2: Menu Display and Navigation** (AC: #7, #8, #9, #10)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Develop UI components for displaying menu categories and items.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement a smooth scrolling or tabbed navigation for categories.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create a modal or separate view for detailed item information and customization.
- [ ] **Task 3: Performance Optimization** (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Implement server-side caching for menu data to ensure fast API responses.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Optimize images by using modern formats (e.g., WebP) and lazy loading.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Minify CSS and JavaScript assets to reduce load times.
- [ ] **Task 4: Search Functionality** (AC: #11)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Add a search bar to the menu page.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement a client-side or server-side search algorithm to filter menu items.

## Dev Notes
This story is one of the most critical from a customer experience perspective. The "zero-friction" principle is paramount. The entire flow, from scanning the QR code to viewing the menu, must be incredibly fast and intuitive. Performance is not just a technical requirement but a core feature. The frontend should be lightweight, with minimal dependencies, to ensure the fastest possible load times on mobile networks.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/public_menu/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the public-facing menu.
- `apps/backend/app/features/menu/`: Contains the FastAPI routers that serve the public menu data.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story consumes the QR code URLs generated in **Story 2.1**.
- It displays the menu data managed through **Story 1.5**.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility is essential.
  - Performance testing on simulated slow networks is mandatory.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Use browser-based testing tools like Playwright or Selenium to automate UI tests across different browsers.
  - Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure and assert performance metrics.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the menu loading time on a simulated 3G network and ensure it is under 2 seconds.
  - Verify that the menu renders correctly on the latest versions of Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android).
  - Test the search functionality with various queries, including partial matches and misspellings.
  - Run accessibility checks to ensure the menu is usable for customers with disabilities.
