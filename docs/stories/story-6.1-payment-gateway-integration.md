# Story 6.1: Payment Gateway Integration

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want to** integrate a secure payment gateway,
**so that** customers can make payments and restaurants can receive funds safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system is integrated with the Stripe payment gateway.
2. Webhook endpoints are set up to handle payment events from Stripe.
3. Multiple payment methods (cards, digital wallets) are configured.
4. PCI compliance measures are implemented.
5. Separate sandbox and production environments are configured.
6. Card payments are processed securely, including 3D Secure authentication.
7. Payment authorization and capture are handled correctly.
8. Refunds and partial refunds can be processed.
9. Stripe Connect accounts are set up for restaurants to manage payouts.
10. A platform fee and commission structure is implemented.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Stripe Integration** (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Set up Stripe API keys and configure the backend service.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement a webhook handler to process events like `payment_intent.succeeded`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Ensure all communications with Stripe are secure and meet PCI standards.
- [ ] **Task 2: Payment Processing Logic** (AC: #6, #7, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Implement the logic to create Stripe PaymentIntents for orders.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Handle the various payment statuses and update the order accordingly.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Develop a service for processing refunds.
- [ ] **Task 3: Restaurant Account Management** (AC: #9, #10)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Integrate Stripe Connect to allow restaurants to link their bank accounts.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement an onboarding flow for restaurants to set up their payment accounts.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Develop the logic to automatically calculate and deduct platform fees from transactions.

## Dev Notes
Payment integration is a highly sensitive and critical part of the system. Security and reliability are the top priorities. Using a well-established provider like Stripe abstracts away much of the complexity of handling raw credit card data, but careful implementation is still required to ensure compliance and a smooth user experience. The use of Stripe Connect is key to the multi-tenant financial model, allowing for clean separation of funds between the platform and the restaurants.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/backend/app/features/payments/`: Contains the FastAPI routers and services for interacting with the Stripe API.
- `infra/supabase/migrations/`: SQL files defining the `payments` and `restaurant_payment_accounts` tables.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story is a prerequisite for **Story 6.2 (Customer Payment Flow)**, which will use the payment intents created here.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - All payment-related logic must have 100% test coverage.
  - Use Stripe's test cards and mock webhook events to simulate various payment scenarios.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write extensive integration tests that mock the Stripe API to simulate successful payments, failures, and refunds.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the webhook handler to ensure it correctly processes different event types from Stripe.
  - Verify that the platform fee is calculated and deducted correctly.
  - Test the Stripe Connect onboarding flow for restaurants.
  - Simulate a failed payment and ensure the system handles it gracefully without marking the order as paid.
