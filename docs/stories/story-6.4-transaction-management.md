## Dev Notes
This story provides restaurant owners with the financial visibility and control they need to manage their business. The key is to present complex financial data in a way that is easy to understand and actionable. All financial data should be sourced directly from the payment gateway (Stripe) as the single source of truth to ensure accuracy.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/transactions/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the transaction management dashboard.
- `apps/backend/app/features/transactions/`: Contains the FastAPI routers for fetching transaction data and processing refunds.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story is the administrative counterpart to **Story 6.2 (Customer Payment Flow)**. It allows restaurant managers to see and manage the transactions created by customers.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - Financial calculations and report generation must be tested for accuracy.
  - The refund process must be tested to ensure it correctly updates the transaction status and returns the funds.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write tests to verify the accuracy of the transaction summary aggregations. Simulate the refund process and ensure the correct API calls are made to Stripe.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the date range filters for financial reports and ensure the data is accurate for the selected period.
  - Verify that a processed refund is correctly reflected in the transaction summary.
  - Test the report export functionality and validate the contents of the generated CSV/PDF file.
