# Story 0.2: Testing Framework Implementation

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to have comprehensive testing frameworks set up for both frontend and backend,
**so that** I can write reliable tests and maintain code quality throughout development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `pytest` framework is configured with async support for the backend.
2. A test database is set up with isolated test data.
3. API endpoint testing is configured using `TestClient`.
4. Database testing is established with test containers or mocking.
5. Authentication testing is implemented with mock JWT tokens.
6. Code coverage reporting is configured with a target of over 90%.
7. Fixtures for common test data (e.g., restaurants, users, orders) are created.
8. A unit testing framework for frontend business logic is in place.
9. Widget testing for UI components is configured.
10. Integration testing for complete user flows is set up.
11. GetX controller testing with mocks is implemented.
12. API service testing with mock responses is configured.
13. Golden testing for visual regression is established.
14. Test coverage reporting for the frontend is configured.
15. End-to-end testing for critical user journeys is implemented.
16. API contract testing between the frontend and backend is set up.
17. A GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing is created.
18. Test results reporting and badge generation are included in the CI/CD pipeline.
19. Branch protection rules require tests to pass before merging.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Backend Testing Setup** (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Configure `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement a fixture to manage a separate test database.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Write tests for API endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient`.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Create mocks for Supabase and other external services.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Configure `pytest-cov` to generate coverage reports.
- [ ] **Task 2: Frontend Testing Setup** (AC: #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Configure `flutter_test` for unit, widget, and integration tests.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement mock services using `mocktail`.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Set up golden tests for key UI components.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Configure test coverage generation for Flutter tests.
- [ ] **Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline** (AC: #17, #18, #19)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Add steps to run backend and frontend tests in parallel.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Integrate with a code coverage service like Codecov.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Configure branch protection rules on the main branches.

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundation for quality assurance across the project. A robust testing framework is critical for catching regressions, validating functionality, and enabling developers to refactor with confidence. The implementation should provide a seamless and automated testing experience that integrates directly into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/backend/tests/`: Directory for all Python backend tests.
- `apps/backend/conftest.py`: Central location for `pytest` fixtures.
- `apps/frontend/test/`: Directory for all Flutter frontend tests.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow definition for running the test suite.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story builds directly on **Story 0.1 (Development Environment Setup)**. The testing environment will rely on the containerized services defined in that story, particularly the database.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for structuring tests.
  - Test names should be descriptive and clearly state what is being tested.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: `pytest` for test execution, `TestClient` for API testing, `mock` for isolating components.
  - Frontend: `flutter_test` for unit and widget testing, `integration_test` for end-to-end flows, `mocktail` for mocking.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - The primary deliverable of this story is the testing framework itself. Therefore, the "testing" is the implementation of the framework.
  - Create a sample test for both the backend and frontend to prove the framework is working correctly.
  - The CI/CD pipeline must successfully run these sample tests.
