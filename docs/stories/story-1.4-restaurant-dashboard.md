## Dev Notes
The dashboard is the central hub for restaurant managers and owners. It needs to provide a high-level overview of the business at a glance, while also offering real-time insights into ongoing operations. The use of real-time data streams is crucial for the "Live Operations" section to be effective. Performance is also key; the dashboard should load quickly and feel responsive, even when displaying a large amount of data.

### Relevant Source Tree Information

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - Dashboard data accuracy is critical and must be tested thoroughly.
  - Real-time updates should be tested to ensure they are timely and correct.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write tests to verify the correctness of the data aggregation queries.
  - Frontend: Use integration tests to simulate real-time updates and verify that the UI reflects the changes correctly.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test that the revenue summary matches the sum of individual order totals for the selected period.
  - Verify that when an order's status is updated, the change is reflected in the "Live Orders" panel within 2 seconds.
  - Test the "Quick Actions" to ensure they trigger the correct backend operations.
