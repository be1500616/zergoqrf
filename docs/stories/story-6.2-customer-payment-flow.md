## Dev Notes
The customer payment flow is the final step in the ordering process and is crucial for revenue collection. The user experience must be seamless and secure to build trust. Integrating directly with the Stripe mobile SDKs (Payment Sheet) is the recommended approach as it provides a native feel and handles much of the complexity of different payment methods and 3D Secure.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/payment/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the payment screen.
- `apps/backend/app/features/payments/`: Contains the FastAPI routers for creating PaymentIntents.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story relies on the payment gateway integration from **Story 6.1**.
- It is the final step in the customer journey that starts with **Story 3.1 (Menu Browsing)**.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - The payment flow must be tested end-to-end using Stripe's test cards.
  - All payment methods (card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) should be tested.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Use integration tests to simulate the entire payment process, from loading the payment screen to receiving a successful confirmation.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the tipping calculation with different percentages and custom amounts.
  - Verify that the bill splitting logic correctly divides the total amount.
  - Simulate a failed payment and ensure that the user is shown a clear error message and can retry.
  - Test the "save payment method" functionality.
