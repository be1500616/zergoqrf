# Story 3.4: Order Tracking & Status Updates

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** customer,
**I want to** track my order status in real-time,
**so that** I know when my food will be ready and can plan accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The current order status is displayed with a visual progress indicator.
2. An estimated completion time is shown and updated live.
3. The order timeline is displayed with timestamps for each status change.
4. The status updates automatically without requiring a page refresh.
5. The preparation status of individual items is visible.
6. Push notifications are sent for major status changes (e.g., "ready for pickup").
7. Kitchen staff can update the status of items and the overall order.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Real-Time Communication** (AC: #4, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Implement a WebSocket or use Supabase Realtime to push order status updates from the backend to the frontend.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create a service on the frontend to listen for these updates.
- [ ] **Task 2: Order Tracking UI** (AC: #1, #2, #3, #5)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Design and build a UI to visualize the order's progress.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement the logic to dynamically update the UI based on the real-time data.
- [ ] **Task 3: Notification System** (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Integrate a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement the backend logic to trigger notifications at key status changes.
- [ ] **Task 4: Kitchen Interface Integration** (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Provide endpoints or a UI for kitchen staff to update the status of orders and items.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Ensure these updates are immediately broadcast to the customer's tracking screen.

## Dev Notes
The real-time order tracking feature is a key differentiator that enhances the customer experience by reducing uncertainty. A reliable and low-latency real-time communication channel is the most critical technical component of this story. The UI should be designed to be clear and reassuring, providing customers with confidence that their order is progressing as expected.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/order_tracking/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the customer-facing order tracking screen.
- `apps/backend/app/features/orders/`: Contains the FastAPI routers and WebSocket logic for broadcasting order status updates.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story directly follows **Story 3.3 (Order Placement)** and depends on the order data created in that process.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - The real-time update mechanism must be tested for reliability and low latency.
  - The accuracy of the estimated completion time updates should be validated.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write tests for the WebSocket logic to ensure that status updates are correctly broadcast to the appropriate clients.
  - Frontend: Use integration tests to simulate receiving status updates and verify that the UI updates accordingly.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test the end-to-end flow: an action in the kitchen interface should result in a UI update on the customer's screen within 3 seconds.
  - Verify that push notifications are sent and received correctly.
  - Test the behavior of the tracking screen during network interruptions and reconnections.
