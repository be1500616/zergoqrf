# Story 2.1: Simple QR Code Generation (Public Access)

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** restaurant manager,
**I want to** generate simple, public QR codes for all my tables,
**so that** customers can scan and immediately access my menu without any barriers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. QR codes contain a simple, public URL in the format `https://app.zergoqrf.com/menu/{restaurantSlug}/{tableId}`.
2. The generated QR codes have no security tokens, expiry dates, or encryption.
3. QR codes can be generated for individual tables in under 2 seconds.
4. Bulk generation for all restaurant tables is completed in under 30 seconds.
5. QR codes are available in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF).
6. The management interface provides a visual grid of tables showing their QR status.
7. A one-click QR generation option is available for new tables.
8. QR codes can be previewed before downloading.
9. QR codes are optimized for reliable mobile camera scanning.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: QR Code Generation Service** (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Implement a backend service to generate QR codes based on table and restaurant data.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Ensure the service can output QR codes in the specified formats and resolutions.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Optimize the generation process for speed and efficiency.
- [ ] **Task 2: Management Interface** (AC: #6, #7, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Develop a UI in the admin dashboard for managing QR codes.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement features for individual, bulk, and preview generation.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create a mechanism to download a ZIP file containing all QR codes.
- [ ] **Task 3: QR Code Optimization** (AC: #9)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Fine-tune the QR code parameters (e.g., error correction level) for optimal scannability.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Add an option to embed the restaurant's logo in the center of the QR code.

## Dev Notes
This story focuses on simplicity and friction-free access. The QR codes are intentionally "dumb," containing only a public URL. This approach avoids the complexity and potential points of failure associated with signed or expiring tokens. Security is handled at the subsequent stages (order placement), not at the menu access stage. This design choice is a core principle of the ZERGO QR system, prioritizing a seamless customer experience.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/qr_generation/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the QR code management interface.
- `apps/backend/app/features/qr/`: Contains the FastAPI routers and services for generating QR codes.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story depends on **Story 1.2 (Table Management)** to get the list of tables for which QR codes need to be generated.
- The URLs generated in this story will be consumed by **Story 3.1 (Menu Browsing)**.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - QR codes must be tested for scannability across a range of devices and apps.
  - Performance benchmarks for generation speed must be met.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write tests to verify that the generated QR code, when scanned, contains the correct URL.
  - Frontend: Test the UI flow for generating and downloading QR codes.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test scanning the generated QR codes with at least three different mobile devices (iOS and Android).
  - Verify that the bulk download feature creates a correctly structured ZIP file.
  - Test the performance of generating QR codes for a restaurant with 100+ tables.
