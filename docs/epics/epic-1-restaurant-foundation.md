## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**

- Supabase instance configured
- Basic Flutter app and FastAPI backend setup
- Development environment established

**Blocks:**

- Epic 2 (QR Infrastructure) - Cannot start until restaurant foundation is stable
- All customer-facing features depend on this epic

## Technical Architecture

**Database Schema:**

- `restaurants` table with RLS policies
- `tables` table for layout management
- `restaurant_staff` with role-based permissions
- `orders` table with status tracking
- `payments` table with Razorpay integration

**API Endpoints:**

- Restaurant CRUD operations
- Staff management APIs
- Order processing endpoints
- Payment integration APIs

**Frontend Components:**

- Restaurant admin dashboard
- Table layout editor
- Order management interface
- Staff login and role switching

## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk Items:**

- Payment integration complexity → Start with Razorpay sandbox early
- Staff adoption resistance → Include comprehensive training materials
- Real-time notification reliability → Test with multiple restaurant scenarios

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Pilot program with 5 friendly restaurants
- Daily standups with restaurant feedback
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Rollback procedures for each story

## Definition of Done

**Technical:**

- [ ] All APIs have 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Frontend components are responsive and accessible
- [ ] Database migrations are backwards compatible
- [ ] Security audit passed for authentication system

**Functional:**

- [ ] Restaurant can complete full order workflow without technical support
- [ ] All staff roles can perform their functions correctly
- [ ] Payment processing handles all edge cases gracefully
- [ ] System performs under expected load (100 concurrent orders)

**Business:**

- [ ] 5 pilot restaurants successfully processing orders daily
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production for 1 week
- [ ] Restaurant satisfaction score >4.0/5.0
- [ ] All success criteria metrics achieved
