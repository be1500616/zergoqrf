## ⚙️ TECHNOLOGY Layer - Implementation Stack

### Frontend Technology Stack (Flutter Migration)

**Core Framework & Language**:

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.24+ for cross-platform mobile and web applications
- **Language**: Dart 3.2+ with null safety and strong typing capabilities
- **Target Platforms**: iOS, Android, Web (Progressive Web App)

**Architecture & State Management**:

- **State Management**: GetX 4.x for lightweight, reactive state management and controller-driven architecture
- **Architecture**: Feature-based modular architecture with clean separation
- **Navigation**: GoRouter 12+ for declarative, type-safe routing with deep linking
- **Dependency Injection**: GetX Bindings and dependency management (`Get.put`, `Get.lazyPut`, `Get.find`)

  GetX Usage Conventions:

  - Navigation Ownership: Use `GoRouter` exclusively for navigation. Do not use GetX navigation to avoid duplication and routing conflicts.
  - Bindings & Lifecycles: Define a `Bindings` class per feature/route to register controllers/services. Prefer `Get.lazyPut` for lazy initialization and ensure explicit disposal for controllers that hold streams/timers.
  - Reactivity Patterns: Prefer `Rx<T>` fields with `Obx` widgets at minimal render boundaries. Avoid placing heavy side-effects inside `Obx`; use GetX workers (`ever`, `debounce`, `interval`) for reactions.
  - Error Handling: Centralize error mapping → UI via a shared handler; standardize snackbars/dialogs for recoverable errors and escalation paths for fatal errors.

**UI/UX Framework**:

- **Design System**: Material Design 3 components with custom ZERGO theming
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, and web
- **Animations**: Custom transitions and micro-interactions for enhanced UX
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader support and accessibility guidelines compliance

  Accessibility Targets:

  - Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text and interactive elements
  - Semantic labels for controls and images; correct focus order across screens
  - Keyboard navigation support on Web, with visible focus indicators
  - Large touch targets (≥ 44x44 pt) and dynamic type support

**Data & Communication**:

- **HTTP Client**: Dio 5.3+ with interceptors for API communication, caching, and retry logic
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences and Hive for offline capabilities and data persistence
- **Secure Storage**: Flutter Secure Storage for sensitive data (tokens, credentials)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration with automatic reconnection handling

  Real-time & Offline Policy:

  - Reconnection strategy: exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s; max 30s) with jitter and max retry cap; reset on successful connection
  - Background/foreground awareness: pause non-critical streams when backgrounded; resume and resync on foreground
  - Offline-first: queue outbound intents locally and flush on reconnect; surface offline banners and last-updated timestamps
  - Heartbeats/timeouts to detect stale connections; idempotent server APIs for safe retry

**Platform & Permissions**:

- iOS: `NSCameraUsageDescription` for QR scanning; validate deep links/Universal Links
- Android: `android.permission.CAMERA`; App Links and intent filters for deep links
- Web/PWA: Feature-detect camera availability; provide manual code entry fallback where camera is unavailable
- QR to route mapping: deep links handled via `GoRouter` with token validation flow

**Navigation & Deep Links (GoRouter)**:

- Route ownership: `GoRouter` is the single source of truth for navigation; avoid `Get.to*` to prevent conflicts
- Core routes (initial set):
  - `/splash` → early redirect based on auth
  - `/login` → authentication screen
  - `/home` → tab shell (Menu tab)
  - `/home/orders` → orders tab
  - `/home/admin` → admin tab (role-restricted)
  - `/menu/:restaurantSlug/:tableId` → public deep link from QR
- Guard policy:
  - Unauthenticated users can access only public QR route; all other routes redirect to `/login`
  - Role-based guard for `/home/admin`
  - Router re-evaluates via `refreshListenable` (auth stream)
- Adoption steps:
  - Add `go_router` package; create a central router with `redirect` and `ShellRoute` for tabs
  - Define a small `NavigationService` wrapping `GoRouter` so controllers can navigate without `BuildContext`
  - Include deep-link tests (iOS/Android/Web) and widget tests for auth redirects and tab navigation
