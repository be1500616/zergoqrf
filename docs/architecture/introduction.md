# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for ZergoQRF, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status**: Greenfield project with established technology foundation
**Foundation**: Flutter 3.4+ frontend with GetX state management and GoRouter navigation, FastAPI backend with Python 3.12+, Supabase managed PostgreSQL with built-in authentication and real-time capabilities.

**Architectural Decisions Already Made**:

- Cross-platform development with Flutter for mobile and web
- High-performance async APIs with FastAPI and Python type hints
- Modern database with Supabase for authentication, real-time updates, and Row Level Security
- Feature-based vertical slice architecture for maintainability
