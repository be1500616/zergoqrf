# Story 3.3: Order Placement & Confirmation

## Status
- **Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** customer,
**I want to** place my order and receive confirmation,
**so that** I can finalize my dining experience and know my order is being prepared.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The customer can review a complete order summary with itemized pricing before placing the order.
2. Special instructions or dietary restrictions can be added to the order.
3. A unique order ID is generated upon successful placement.
4. An order confirmation screen is displayed with all relevant details.
5. An estimated preparation time is provided to the customer.
6. The order is automatically sent to the kitchen display system.
7. The order status progresses through various stages (e.g., received, preparing, ready).
8. The customer receives real-time updates on the order status.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Order Finalization** (AC: #1, #2)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Develop a checkout screen that summarizes the cart and allows for final modifications.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement a feature to add special instructions to the order.
- [ ] **Task 2: Order Placement Logic** (AC: #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create a backend endpoint to handle order submissions. This endpoint should be atomic, creating the order and order items in a single transaction.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement the logic to generate a unique, human-readable order number.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Build the frontend confirmation screen.
- [ ] **Task 3: Kitchen Integration** (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Design the data structure for how orders will be represented in the kitchen system.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement a mechanism (e.g., WebSocket push) to send new orders to the kitchen display in real-time.
- [ ] **Task 4: Real-Time Status Updates** (AC: #7, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Develop the backend logic to manage and broadcast order status changes.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement a listener on the frontend to receive and display these status updates.

## Dev Notes
The order placement is the transactional core of the customer experience. This process must be reliable and provide clear feedback to the customer. Atomicity in the backend is crucial to prevent partial orders or data inconsistencies. The integration with the kitchen display system is a key dependency for restaurant operations.

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- `apps/frontend/lib/features/checkout/`: Contains the Flutter widgets and controllers for the order placement flow.
- `apps/backend/app/features/orders/`: Contains the FastAPI routers for creating and managing orders.
- `infra/supabase/migrations/`: SQL files defining the `orders` and `order_items` tables.

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
- This story is triggered after the customer has finalized their cart in **Story 3.2**.
- The order data generated here will be used in **Story 3.4 (Order Tracking)**.

## Testing
### Relevant Testing Standards
- **Test File Location:**
  - Backend: `apps/backend/tests/`
  - Frontend: `apps/frontend/test/`
- **Test Standards:**
  - The order placement process must be tested end-to-end.
  - The atomicity of the order creation transaction must be verified.
- **Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
  - Backend: Write an integration test that simulates an order placement and verifies that all associated records (`orders`, `order_items`) are created correctly. Test the failure case to ensure no partial data is left behind.
  - Frontend: Use integration tests to simulate the entire checkout process, from cart review to order confirmation.
- **Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
  - Test that special instructions are correctly saved and passed to the kitchen.
  - Verify that the generated order ID is unique.
  - Test the real-time communication to ensure the kitchen receives the order within seconds of placement.
